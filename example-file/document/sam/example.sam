@Style #0@<:S+-2>Purpose: Provide example of this file type

@Style #0@<:S+-2>Document file type: SAM

@Style #0@<:S+-2>Version: 1.0

@Style #0@<:S+-2>Remark: 

@Style #0@<:S+-2>

@Style #0@<:S+-2>Example content:

@Style #0@<:S+-2>The names "<+!>John Doe<-!>" for males, "<+!>Jane Doe<-!>" or "<+!>Jane Roe<-!>" for 
females, or "<+!>Jonnie Doe<-!>" and "<+!>Janie Doe<-!>" for children, or just "<+!>Doe<-!>" 
non-gender-specifically are used as placeholder names for a party 
whose true identity is unknown or must be withheld in a legal action, 
case, or discussion. The names are also used to refer to acorpse or 
hospital patient whose identity is unknown. This practice is widely used in the United States and 
Canada, but is rarely used in other English-speaking countries including the United Kingdom 
itself, from where the use of "John Doe" in a legal context originates. The names Joe Bloggs or 
John Smith are used in the UK instead, as well as in Australia and New Zealand.<:f220,2Calibri,0,0,0>

<:S+-1>

@Style #1@John Doe is sometimes used to refer to a typical male in other contexts as well, in a similar manner to 
John Q. Public, known in Great Britain as Joe Public, John Smith or Joe Bloggs. For example, the first 
name listed on a form is often John Doe, along with a fictional address or other fictional information to 
provide an example of how to fill in the form. The name is also used frequently in popular culture, for 
example in the Frank Capra film <+">Meet John Doe<-">. John Doe was also the name of a 2002 American 
television series.
